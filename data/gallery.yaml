      The stories I tell or the words that I say  
      Whether it be for a second or even a day  
      The words I say you may not care  
      As our friendship lasted for more then a year  

      It's over now the damage is done  
      I have lost and you have won  
      The battle is over it's all in the past  
      My stories with you may they always last  

      It's sad to throw it all a way  
      The stories we said from day to day  
      It's over now the damage is done  
      I'll always remember you as my #1  

      It's sad to see that we must part  

      Friends like us straight from the heart !

    overlayContent: |
      Today is the day I lay it all down  
      I'll walk away without even a frown  
      If it's not good for me it's not good for you  
      I really thought our friendship was forever true.  
      I guess I thought wrong as I read what you wrote  
      I thought you was the screw and I was the bolt  
      I now see things from a different light  
      It's not worth our friendship to keep up this fight  
      I'll stay to myself as I have always done  
      The fight is over and you have won !
