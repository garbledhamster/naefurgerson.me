    overlayContent: |
      “Hope” is the thing with feathers –  
      That perches in the soul –  
      And sings the tune without the words –  
      And never stops – at all –  

      And sweetest – in the Gale – is heard –  
      And sore must be the storm –  
      That could abash the little Bird  
      That kept so many warm –  

      I’ve heard it in the chillest land –  
      And on the strangest Sea –  
      Yet, never, in Extremity,  
      It asked a crumb – of Me.

      Beneath these towering forest pines  
      Our ancestors traced hidden lines  
      Their footprints echo through the green  
      Whispering tales once felt and seen

      In humble dawn’s quiet hush I bow  
      Seeking peace in the here and now  
      A guiding light through shadows cast  
      Renew my soul, hold me steadfast

    overlayContent: |
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
      And sorry I could not travel both  
      And be one traveler, long I stood  
      And looked down one as far as I could  
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

      Then took the other, as just as fair,  
      And having perhaps the better claim,  
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
      Though as for that the passing there  
      Had worn them really about the same,  

      And both that morning equally lay  
      In leaves no step had trodden black.  
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
      I doubted if I should ever come back.  

      I shall be telling this with a sigh  
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—  
      I took the one less traveled by,  
      And that has made all the difference.

      Upon these rugged, ancient cliffs  
      Their silent strength a precious gift  
      Our kin once stood with steadfast grace  
      Their stories etched upon this place

      May each breath calm restless mind  
      In gentle trust new hope we find  
      Hallowed be the quiet grace  
      Guiding us in sacred space

    overlayContent: |
      The stories I tell or the words that I say  
      Whether it be for a second or even a day  
      The words I say you may not care  
      As our friendship lasted for more then a year  

      It's over now the damage is done  
      I have lost and you have won  
      The battle is over it's all in the past  
      My stories with you may they always last  

      It's sad to throw it all a way  
      The stories we said from day to day  
      It's over now the damage is done  
      I'll always remember you as my #1  

      It's sad to see that we must part  

      Friends like us straight from the heart !

    overlayContent: |
      Today is the day I lay it all down  
      I'll walk away without even a frown  
      If it's not good for me it's not good for you  
      I really thought our friendship was forever true.  
      I guess I thought wrong as I read what you wrote  
      I thought you was the screw and I was the bolt  
      I now see things from a different light  
      It's not worth our friendship to keep up this fight  
      I'll stay to myself as I have always done  
      The fight is over and you have won !
