      “Hope” is the thing with feathers –<br>
      That perches in the soul –<br>
      And sings the tune without the words –<br>
      And never stops – at all –<br>
      <br>
      And sweetest – in the Gale – is heard –<br>
      And sore must be the storm –<br>
      That could abash the little Bird<br>
      That kept so many warm –<br>
      <br>
      I’ve heard it in the chillest land –<br>
      And on the strangest Sea –<br>
      Yet, never, in Extremity,<br>
      It asked a crumb – of Me.

      Beneath these towering forest pines<br>
      Our ancestors traced hidden lines<br>
      Their footprints echo through the green<br>
      Whispering tales once felt and seen

      In humble dawn’s quiet hush I bow<br>
      Seeking peace in the here and now<br>
      A guiding light through shadows cast<br>
      Renew my soul, hold me steadfast

    overlayContent: |
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
      And sorry I could not travel both<br>
      And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
      And looked down one as far as I could<br>
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
      <br>
      Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
      And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
      Though as for that the passing there<br>
      Had worn them really about the same,<br>
      <br>
      And both that morning equally lay<br>
      In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
      I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
      <br>
      I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
      I took the one less traveled by,<br>
      And that has made all the difference.

      Upon these rugged, ancient cliffs<br>
      Their silent strength a precious gift<br>
      Our kin once stood with steadfast grace<br>
      Their stories etched upon this place
